#Project Description

He shoots, he scores! Although that phrase might be from hockey, everyone loves to see their favorite NBA player make a nice shot, especially a 3-pointer. We will investigate if 3-pointer frequency affects the outcome of the game. Many aspects of the NBA change over the years: the players, the technology, the viewers, but how does the game itself change? That is what we are going to find out. While the use of the three point shot has a positive correlation with that teamâ€™s win percentage, that correlation is not very strong.
